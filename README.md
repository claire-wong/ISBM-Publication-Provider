# ISBM-Publication-Provider

This is one of the three-part series of proof-of-concept projects with the primary objective of constructing an interoperable IoT information cluster. The focus is on utilizing non-proprietary Open Industrial Interoperability Ecosystem (OIIE) open standards. Each project within this series explores key facets of building a cohesive and scalable IoT infrastructure, demonstrating the potential of OIIE standards in promoting interoperability in the interconnect world.
